## Description 
README Generator is an interactive, Node.js based application that dynamically builds README.md files (named "README-generated.md") with user input obtained via the npm module inquirer. README Generator assists users with creating professional README.md files by dynamically generating a table of contents with clickable navigation, an attractive badge representing the user-chosen license, and optional sections dependent on user choice and input.
